## Polymer Playground

Mist.io front end developers Polymer playground. Create clean and reusable components with default styling, make them communicate with events and then integrate them fast to mist.io platform. Our goal is to prepare here all js manipulations and logic before moving a component to the real platform. Of course there are cases this cannot be done but for most ones this will help you a lot. Remember always to follow our team's guidelines [here](https://github.com/mistio/mist.core/wiki/Mist.io-UI-built-with-Polymer-1.0).
